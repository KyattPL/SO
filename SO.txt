SJF -> Insertion Sort (Preemptive, Non-preemptive, Preemptive with priority). Don't count how many times my queue has been sorted.

RR -> only count switches between processes (without measuring time), if k=10 and process had time=7 then ROT should immediately start next one.

There can be multiple requests at once.
